# ðŸš€ Turborepo starter with shared shadcn/ui components (Vite, Next.js)

This repository is a monorepo starter kit utilizing [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) for managing multiple
applications with shared [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) components. It includes two applications (`vite`
and `nextjs`) in the `apps`
directory, both of which use shared components from the `@repo/ui` package.

This repository is based on https://github.com/dan5py/turborepo-shadcn-ui starter.
